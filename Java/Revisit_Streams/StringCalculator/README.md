KATA:
String Calculator Kata

OBJECTIVE:
It's been a long time since I did a Kata and I've had a bit of experience in Java since then so would like to try it again

REVIEW:
This time round went a lot more smoothly re streams. 

Overall, happier with my solution than I expected though I resisted the urge to refactor into further classes and builders. 

I'm just not sure about passing flags into methods but will do some googling to educate myself on it.
