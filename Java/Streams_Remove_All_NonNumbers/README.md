OBJECTIVE:
I wanted to try using the Java 8 streams while also applying the technique of removing any character that is not a digit or a special character (' ', '-')

REVIEW:
To be quite frank, I think this is the worst peice of code I've ever written. 

Additionally, working with streams was extremely tiresome and most of the time I felt like I was trying to force my code into streams instead of it being natural and part of the code.
